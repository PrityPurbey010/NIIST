        <p>NRI Group of Institutions is a pioneer institution to provide technical and non-technical education in central India. NRI is perpetrated to fabricate an aura and vicinity for nurturing contraption, creativity, and virtue among the students.

          Providing excellent technical education is my mission and of which I flew down from the United States of America to India with the objective of serving my motherland. While studying at Michigan University I dreamed of building a massive education centre with the aim of giving quality education to today’s youth and the dream came true as NRI GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS. So it is not a challenge for me. It is a challenge for those who are making it a commercial venture. NRI Group is consistently providing quality education. It is well known that NRI is among the top colleges, as the honourable Fee Regulation Committee ranked us as “A” GRADE institution, with NBA accreditation, and international accreditation by IAO, ASSOCHAM has acclaimed NRI as the best engineering college for academic infrastructure in Madhya Pradesh. We have also won accolades; as the Captain of Industries, and Icon of Bhopal. In the coming years, NRI will prove itself, as one of India’s premier institutions.</p>

      <div class="chairmanMessage">
        <p>It gives me immense pleasure to lead the department of CSE at NRI Institute of Information Science and Technology. Our college is one of the premier institutions of Engineering and a hub of learning and co-curricular activities. The Department is striving hard towards the goal of providing innovative and quality education with high standards to achieve academic excellence.

          We are witnessing a mammoth transformation in the digital domain invading all aspects of our lives and as such the students and faculty members associated with the Department of CSE cannot remain untouched in these very momentous happenings. Even if we look into Gartner’s forecast of top ten technology trends of 2019, it predicts the relationship of all these technologies are directly related to the in-depth knowledge of Computer Science and associated disciplines. The new IT realities predicted are Adaptive Security Architecture, Advanced System Architecture, Mesh Application, Cyber Security and Service Architecture as well as IoT Architecture and platforms. Cyber Security and IoT are emerging as the third wave in the development of the Internet.
          
          We at Computer Science and Engineering Department have already initiated to keep pace with the emerging technologies by exploring new areas like Big Data/ Business Analytics, Hadoop, Cassandra, MongoDB, etc. We have also developed prototypes for Smart Waste Management and Smart Car Parking, Bidirectional visitors counter using Bluetooth module, Smart Irrigation, Surveillance Rover,  through sensor-based IoT applications. We will be shortly installing an IoT Incubation Centre which will serve as an exciting multi-disciplinary learning and research sandbox of software, electronics, and communication as well as help students and faculty members to explore, experience, and extend cutting-edge technologies. They will be able to investigate a variety of technologies involving smart sensing, pervasive connectivity, virtual interfaces, and ubiquitous computing and their potential application in consumer, retailing, health care, and other industrial domains.
          
          
          The excellent infrastructure, teaching faculty of the best kind along with a Training and Placement Cell ensures a bright future for its students. The department also takes initiative to improve the soft skills, analytical capabilities, and verbal communication of the students so that they can face the competition in the corporate world confidently. Thus I am sure that our Engineers will emerge as assets not only to this institution and to the organization they would belong to in the future, but also to the country at large.
          
          I have the privilege to lead a vibrant group of faculty members who are highly competent and committed to academic excellence. Let us all join together to take the Department to greater heights.</div>
